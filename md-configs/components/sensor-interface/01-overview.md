If you want to how to setup the Sensor Interfaces and how to make them work with **Docker** you can read more about it [here](/docs/SensorInterfaces.md)


> :warning: **Most Sensor Interfaces need root privileges**<br>
> Look into the [Sensor Interface Docs](/docs/SensorInterfaces.md) to see how you can run them without root privileges

> :mag: **How measurements work**<br>
> During the test execution measurements are collected with a sample based approach. So for every n - microseconds it collects a v8 cpu profile and energy measurements of the sensor interface. You can adjust the sampling rate with the `sampleInterval` options in the `.oaklean` config file above.
